# StockMarket

This project was part of my internship at [EGID](https://www.egidegypt.com/).
It is a stock market web application that allows users to register, login, view available stocks, buy stocks, and view their orders.
The app was made using Angular 16, ASP.Net Core 7 and MySQL database.
The app uses i18n and ngx-translate to provide English and Arabic versions.
It also provides light and dark themes.
